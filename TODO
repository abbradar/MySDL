1. Move to MonadIO from MonadBase.
2. Implement netwire backend.
3. Re-do module exportation so that parent modules will include all
   necessary things from children modules.
4. Maybe move back from having absolute Integer time.
5. Fix MonadBaseControl and MonadTransControl instances -- they should
   increase and decrease refcount as needed.
6. Rewrite comments to use Haddock format.
